# Danny Fishman Music

This is a website I built for a fantastic singer/songwriter to provide a one-stop-shop for all his social media / contact info needs as he started his career as a musician. It provided a very simple UI for people to navigate to his various social media account pages as well as listen to a few of his songs or watch some of his YouTube videos. 

Unfortunately, since I was unable to devote enough time to continuing development of the website due to work and other life happenings, Danny has since migrated his portfolio to a SquareSpace site so he could more easily manage his site in a timely manner. The site I built can still be visited at https://fishman-music.herokuapp.com/, (and a prototype site at https://danny-fishman-music.herokuapp.com/) though the songs and videos have since been removed.

Nonetheless, I had fun working on this website while I could, and built some very fun components (mostly to do with audio/video interaction).
